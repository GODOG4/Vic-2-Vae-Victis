# Vic-2-Vae-Victis

Current Release = 0.25 (Alpha Release, approaching stability but still unproven in MP. Recommended to wait until 1.0 if you want a stable experience)

Based loosely on the 'Post Finem' Eu4 mod but with many changes.

Also loosely based on the  'Little Dark Age' mod.

The base mod used is IGoR_puir v13.0.4 with some features/changes from CoRGI and other IGoR forks.

The basic PoD is that Carthage won the Punic Wars and established a (short lived) hegemony over the Western Mediterranean. The mod takes place in 666 AD although industrialization has already started to get going in the Punic and Hellenic worlds since 600 AD.

General Changes: 

* Pop rebalances: 
    * -33% and -25% pop nerfs to Northern Europe 
    * 20-30% pop buffs to the Mediterranean and other important areas
    * New World pops re-arranged and lowered
    * Nerfed Indian by a large factor, even lower than LDA
* New feature: Pop Group Assimilation
    * Instead of having epic 'get accepted culture' decisions now there is a flat assimilation buff to any culture that is in your Culture Group
    * Certain decisions with certain countries will either expand this bonus to other culture groups or give a targeted modifier to assimilate a single culture(s) that is often even stronger
    * Getting extra accepted by decisions is extremely rare, the most a country will ever have is 1 extra culture and they usually will start with it. Assimilation is the focus
* Imported LDA's New World colony system and added a new colony you can set up East Africa (Zanzibar) instead of South Africa
* Testing removing Mobilization buffs. Flat 2-4% the entire game since assimilation is a big focus instead of just growing your core pop group.
* Most of Northern Europe is unciv although they get a temporary Army buff to help them resist colonization for the first 10 years.
* Extra Decisions from LDA but now based per Country and Religion and they last like 3-4 years at least.
* RGO changes. North europe nerfed and a lot of coal and sulphur moved to the 'civilized' world. 
* The 'Crime' System has been repurposed now for *Monuments*. Several monuments exist at game start across the world which give it's province owner several different bonuses. Some countries can build new Monuments even.
* Navigable Rivers (Current list: Mississippi, Great Lakes/St Lawrence, Congo River, Amazon River)

Future plans and ideas:

* More religious decisions and ways for countries to convert to different religions.
* Finishing LOC overhaul of Europe and North Africa. Lot of placeholder names and some names I took from Post Finem that I don't agree with.
* More Monuments and some extra bonuses for certain monuments: For example in Illyria the Hall of the Pantheons will allow the currently holder to temporarily synchronize with another Religion and use their bonuses.
* Late game decisions to shake up the end game of a campaign such as Hellenic nations with the 'Diadochi' flag getting special CBs on states of Alexander's Empire. Can be enabled or disabled by Host Nation.
* Replacement for the Liberal Revolt where Hellenic and Punic nations deal with a great 'religious awakening' of their subjects trying to preserve or return to their old traditions, with a few nations able to take advantage of this chaos and go down alternative paths (Such as Seleucia embracing Babylonian/Assyrian gods and building Ziggurats although abandoning their Diadochi claim if they do so.)
* Reworks of some nations with placeholder content (Parthia for example) and finishing out Asia
* Expanding upon LDA's colony system. Probably add ways to invest in your colony more
* Adding navigable waterways in America, Kongo, China, etc.
* Adding content for 6 optionally playable nations:
	* Bactria
	* Finland/Suomi
	* Nephi/Lehi (yes this is Mormon LARP)
	* Ammissae Legiones 
	* Ashina Khaganate (Turkic China)
	* Leland Commandery (Korea)
