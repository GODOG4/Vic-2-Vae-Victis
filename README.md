# Vic-2-Vae-Victis

Current Release = 0.1 (Alpha Release, bugs galore are expected. Recommended to wait until 1.0 if you want a stable experience)

Based loosely on the 'Post Finem' Eu4 mod but with many changes.

Also loosely based on the  'Little Dark Age' mod.

The base mod used is IGoR_puir v13.0.4

The basic PoD is that Carthage won the Punic Wars and established a (short lived) hegemony over the Western Mediterranean. The mod takes place in 666 AD although industrialization has already started to get going in the Punic and Hellenic worlds since 600 AD.

General Changes: 

* Pop rebalances: 
	* -33% and -25% pop nerfs to Northern Europe 
	* 20-30% pop buffs to the Mediterranean and other important areas
	* New World pops re-arranged and lowered
	* Nerfed Indian by a large factor, even lower than LDA
* New feature: Pop Group Assimilation
	* Instead of having epic 'get accepted culture' decisions now there is a flat assimilation buff to any culture that is in your Culture Group
	* Certain decisions with certain countries will either expand this bonus to other culture groups or give a targeted modifier to assimilate a single culture(s) that is often even stronger
	* Getting extra accepted by decisions is extremely rare, the most a country will ever have is 1 extra culture and they usually will start with it. Assimilation is the focus
* Imported LDA's New World colony system. 
* Testing removing Mobilization buffs. Flat 2-4% the entire game.
* Most of Northern Europe is unciv although the dumbest retards get a temporary Army buff to help them resist colonization for the first 10 years.
* Extra Decisions from LDA but now based per Country and Religion and they last like 3-4 years at least.

I'll write all the other details later, kys Ryan.
