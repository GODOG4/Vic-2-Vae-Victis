EVTNAME992271;Culture Group Assimilation Bonus;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992271;In Vae Victis, in addition to IGOR assimilation, there is an additional 200% assimilation bonus for all cultures that match your Culture Group. Several decisions for countries also give 200%-400% bonuses to other cultures. Gaining accepted cultures is almost unheard of in this mod and most nations will have only 1 culture accepted. The assim bonus is very noticable and within a few decades you'll establish a large majority.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992273;Immigration System;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992273;The immigration system in Vae Victis is a bit different from IGOR: At the start of the game the 3 African nations start as Immigrant Nations and will evenly get immigrants with split immigration. However, once American Colonies start to get going the African Nations will lose their New World status and immigration will focus entirely on the New World. Immigration is split into 3 month blocks so that every New World colony will get some Immigrants. Note that likely late game, if all New World nations are annexed, the African Tags will start to get immigrants again.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992274;Romqart Federation Formation;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992274;The Romqart Federation is a timed formable that can be formed by either Rewm, Punicum, and Illyria. Any nation that forms this keeps their primary culture, but the Province of Rewm is automatically assimilated and you gain a massive 600% assimilation bonus for the Rewmqart and Italic cultures. This works much like how the Italy Formation is set up in IGOR: There's several provinces which are considered Victory Points: Mediolanum, Modena, Florence, Rewm, Sicily, Tyrae, Trieste, and Iader. If you own a certain amount of Victory Points, you will get the decision to form the Rewmqart Federation and automatically annex Rewm and Italia. You will need 8 Victory points in 670 at first but every 5 years the amount of VPs needed lowers by 1 down to 5. Rewm has a easier path and can form with 7-4 VPs. However, if you do not form this nation before the year 700, or if Italia forms Rome, then you will perminantly lose your chance to form this nation! This feature is subject to expansion such as changing the VPs, adding extra bonuses for Rewm to make them less of a lame duck nation, and some further decision after forming the Federation.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992275;RESERVED FOR A FUTURE FEATURE (religion);;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992275;This feature is reserved to explain the Religious System once it's fully implemented.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992276;RESERVED FOR A FUTURE FEATURE (late game decisions);;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992276;This feature is reserved for the late game (720) super decisions and events to shake up the late game, such as the Diadochi Wars and the Hyperborean Revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992277;Westernization;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992277;In IGoR, uncivilized tech reforms now grant you their corresponding tech while you are still uncivilized. Upon westernizing, you will inherit those same techs as if they were researched normally (wait for the month tick). Not much has changed in Vae Victis, however Conquest RP has been entirely removed from Reforms. Some nations will get a bonus which gives them back Conquest RP however.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992278;Combat;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992278;In IGoR combat has been rebalanced from Vanilla significantly. There are now 3 different unit types before 730: Baseline Units (Hussar, Artillery, Regulars) that have balanced attack and defense stats. /// Offensive Units (Cuirassier, Offensive Artillery, Offensive Infantry) that have more attack stats than baseline units but less defensive stats. /// Defensive Units (Dragoon, Defensive Artillery, Defensive Infantry) that have more defense stats than baseline units but less attack stats.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992279;Supply/Reinforcement Information;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992279;Because of the way the game's supply system works not having 100% supply is devastating to reinforcement. It is for this reason it is incredibly important to make sure you can 100% supply your army otherwise you will lack reinforcement. If you reinforce 50% you will only get 50% reinforcement for the first unit and then a diminishing 50% for each sequesential unit. The first brigade may reinforce 900 the next 450 after that 225 and so on. This is why not having 100% supply is devastating.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992280;World Bank;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992280;In IGoR, there is a world bank which replaces the function of gold. This serves as the games method of pumping money into the economy. The world bank will buy the excess RGO goods the entire game.;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME992281;Naval System;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992281;IGoR uses a no naval cap system for navy. In this version of no naval cap, you must have 85% supply in order to not attrition.;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992282;Migration and Emigration;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992282;Pops migrate based on a variety of factors, such as: Literacy, Goods Availability, Militancy/Consciousness, Political Reforms, etc. Scaling levels of each of these factors will result in more internal migration (Pops moving from State to State, State to Colony, and Colony to Colony but never moves from Colony to State) in addition to emigration (Leaving your country to join another).;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992283;Immigration System;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992283;The immigration system in IGoR currently rotates each month. This means that one month North America will receive all the immigrants while South America gets none and then the next month, South America will receive all the immigrants while North America gets none. The only exception to this rule is the USA, who recieves immigration during both periods.;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992284;Colonization Rework;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992284;In IGoR, colonization is enabled in two phases. Phase One unlocks with the Colonial Negotiations invention in 705 (Found under the Breech-loaded Rifles Tech). Phase two unlocks with the Indigenous Garrisoning invention in 715 (Found under Nationalism and Imperialism Tech). Phase 1 allows all provinces with a liferating of 20 or higher to be colonized. Phase two allows all provinces with a liferating of 10 or higher to be colonized.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME992285;Assimilation;;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC992285;In IGoR, the assimilation system has been completely reworked to function universally, so long as the population you want to assimilate is in a state and not a colony. The Equality national value gives a flat 50% increase to assimilation. Pops with higher literacy, lower consciousness, and lower militancy will assimilate marginally faster.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
