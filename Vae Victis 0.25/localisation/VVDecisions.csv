extra_funding_on_title;Enable Extra Spending Decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
extra_funding_on_desc;Our treasury is full of abundance, we should fund certain cultural curiosities\n\n\n?RIf our treasury drops below 50k we will stop funding our projects!\n ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,, 
extra_funding_off_title;Disable Extra Spending Decisions;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
extra_funding_off_desc;We don't need to waste our money on fruitless efforts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
deify_hanno_on_title;Enable the Cult of Hanno;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
deify_hanno_on_desc;The Cult of Hanno teaches and encourages migration to new lands, to new colonies. Now is a good time to subtly encourage their worship to help us with further colonization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,, 
deify_hanno_off_title;Disable the Cult of Hanno;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
deify_hanno_off_desc;We have no more need for the Cult of Hanno at this time, we should pass laws restricting their influence once more.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

convert_neterist_desc;§GThis decision will greatly increase your assimilation of the Kemetic culture! (400%)\n\n§!It's proven rather difficult to assimilate the Kemetic people in our empire. After the initial attempts at Synchronization, the Ptolemies have largely abandoned that effort in favor of maintaining Hellenic orthodoxy, under the influence of the Archon of Athens. This clearly was a mistake: Only through synchronization can we truly create a new Dynasty to rival, maybe even surpass, Alexander.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

extra_funding_off_desc;We don't need to waste our money on fruitless efforts;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
rebuild_babylon_title;Rebuild Babylon;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
rebuild_babylon_desc;Babylon, once the greatest city on earth, has been largely abandoned for other nearby cities, such as Seleucia. It's monuments have fallen into disrepair, but it's legacy is still alive in Mesopotamia. We should rebuild this once great City back to it's former glory.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
CRO_inherits_ALB_title;Destroy Nekharot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
CRO_inherits_ALB_desc;After the annhilation of Judea by the Seleucids, many of the rival Diadochi accepted the fleeing Judeans, hoping to use them as loyal warriors and subjects eager to reclaim their holy land. In a perverse act, the Macedonians created a 'New Holy Land' for the Judeans in the former lands of Dardania. We must destroy this farce of a nation and expell the Judeans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
CRO_Dacia_title;Illyro-Dacian legacy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
CRO_Dacia_desc;§GThis decision will greatly increase your assimilation of the Dakijan Culture (200%)\n\n§!Our smartest anthropologists have proven without a shadow of a doubt (ignoring any evidence to the contrary) that the Dacians and our Illyrian people were once one and the same. The Dacians recently have come under cultural influence of the Slavic barbarians, calling themselves 'Dakijans' now, but we can easily remind them of our shared legacy by our shared language: The Sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

restore_romana_republic_desc;The Romqart, the 'New Romans' have abandoned their Latin heritage and language for the language of their Punic conquerors.

form_romqart_federation_desc;Following the collapse of the Carthaginian Empire, the Rewmqart Federation was formed first as just a league of Punic Colonies in Italy to fend off the Gauls, Latins, and Germans. It evolved and expanded, but it's decentralized nature lead to it's collapse. Now, we are in a position to claim it's legitimacy for our own: Glory to Rewm!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
form_iber_title;Form Iber;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
form_iber_desc;The Barqanesh of Iberia and north Africa have long since been disunited. First, under the Carthaginian yolk, then the Suebian invaders pushed us further to the brink. We will be stronger together!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

They even converted and worship Punic gods, fooling the rest of the civilized world to think they were not barbarians anymore. Now with our successful Reconquest of Iberia, we can resettle and recivilze these lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
suebi_retvrn_title;Return Home to Germania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
suebi_retvrn_desc;Many year ago, German Tribes attempted to migrate south to warmer lands. The farthest most got was Pannonia, the rest were brutally slaughtered. We were one of the lucky few who managed to settle in a new land. But our German brothers back home are suffering, languishing in stagnation and poverty. If anyone had the right to bring 'civilization' to the Germans, it's us!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
suebi_iber_title;A Suebian Iberia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
suebi_iber_desc;The Celtiberians were rather easy to assimilate, but the Barqanesh proved much more resistant to our rightful claim to these lands. Now though, we've finally snuffed out any resistance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
sisters_of_tanit_reborn_title;Avenge the Massacre of Tanit's Virgins;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
sisters_of_tanit_reborn_desc;Many years ago, the Civilized World extended much further north into Gaul. However, the perfidious Gauls struck with fury, slaughtering hundreds of villages, including the peaceful virgins at the old Temple of Tanit in Alesia. The surviving members, along with other Punic refugees, formed the miltant Sisters of Tanit, dedicated to the destruction of the Gauls. Now that they've finally been destroyed, they seek to helping us maintain the eternal subjugation of these vile people, forever more.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

construct_motya_cothon_title;Construct the Grand Motya Cothon;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
construct_motya_cothon_desc;Motya has long been an important Cothon, but in recent years it's become woefully out of date compared to the Grand Cothon in Carthage. We should modernized this important port and raise it to the same importance;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
construct_motya_cothon_title;Rebuild the Kitiya Cothon;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

end_the_numidian_revolt_desc;§GThis decision will greatly increase your assimilation of the Numidian Culture (400%)\n\n§!With the final destruction of the Mauritanian Kingdom, the Numidian revolt has lost it's steam.

AUS_HUN_union_desc;Follwoing the untimely death of Guthred Herelingas, Regent of Vildheim, in a disasterous raid on Illyria, the kingdom has descended into Chaos. We should use this instability to assert our selves onto them with an offer to for them to rejoin the Gaugraf.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

info_unciv_title;Vae Victis Northern Europe Info;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
info_unciv_desc;Northern Europe is largely unciv, and you've been unfortunately rostered as one of these nations. There is no Conquest RP by default, only once your form your nation do you get it usually. For now, they are intended to be a bit underpowered, but depending on feedback new decisions will be added to make playing and surviving there a bit more bearable.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
info_rewm_title;Vae Victis Rewmqart Federation Info;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
info_rewm_desc;You are playing one of the three nations which can form the Rewmqart Federation: Rewm, Illyria, and Celtipunicum. Forming this nation is based on PUIR Italy formation with the following Victory Points: Mediolanum, Modena, Florence, Rewm, Sicily, Tyrae, Trieste, and Iader. However, this is a timed formable.\n\n§RIf this nation is not formed by 700, or if Italia forms (real) Rome, then the option of forming this nation is Lost forever, much like forming HRE in DoD.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
info_india_title;Vae Victis India Info;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
info_india_desc;The Indian thunderdome is between one native Indian tag and 2 colonizers. Mauryans start out with a bad debuff and the two other nations have the usual Culture Group bonus against Indian cultures. If you only want to roster one Indian nation I would suggest either Indo-Greeks or Sevasm instead of Maurya since they have a much slower but stable start.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
info_persia_title;Vae Victis Parthia Info;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
info_persia_desc;Parthia is still a largely WiP nation as I can't figure out any good ideas for them: they need something as the Aryan culture is a true Isolate culture. For now, they have a scaling assimilation bonus against *all* pops in the Central Asian Continent, as seen in the decision picture here, but please let me know if you have any better ideas for them.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
info_africa_title;Vae Victis Africa Info;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
info_africa_desc;The 3 'Old World Colonial Nations' start out as the only Immigrant nations in the game, however this will not last. After 690, they will lose their New World status and stop gaining Immigration as all the Immigrants will likely flow to the American Puppets...However they will get a massive assimilation bonus against Barbarian culture after losing their New World status. Essentially, you should try to hoover up as many Immigrants as possible before 690, then you have to actually play like a real nation afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
